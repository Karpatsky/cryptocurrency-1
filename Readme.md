### Notes
* Reddit (r/CryptoCurrency + r/Best_of_crypto) keyword mentions
* Basis: comment.body for comments > 2 points, with currency symbols replaced for full names.
* Filtered for https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/ "All"; excluding common dictionary words:
    `{'money', 'crypto', 'burst', 'steps', 'rise', 'block', 'verge', 'version', 'universe', 'impact', 'tickets', 'altcoin'}`
* Notes:
    * Much chatter is likely due to past market movements, be wary
    * Market Caps at final value, i.e. not representative of the time period.
    * Due to unfortunate naming of some coins, and general challenges of text processing, it's is likely that mentions will be missing or superfluous in the below listing. We'll work to increase the accuracy in future releases.
* Sentiment is still very rough. (mean - stddev/2)*10 for sentences with abs polarity > 0.2
* Minimum # mentions: 10
* Total mentions: 1
* Last updated: 2017-06-20T23:12:42.954353
* Time period: 2017-04-30 - 2017-06-20
